            <p>they're falling down all around,
            <br />
            yet nothing is wrong.
            <br />
            destruction is taking place,
            <br />
            after far too long.
            <br />
            
            <br />
            what serves to support the rest,
            <br />
            just gets in my way.
            <br />
            no need, no need, no purpose,
            <br />
            no reason to stay.
            <br />
            
            <br />
            unnoticed by most, how come?
            <br />
            always there, being there.
            <br />
            hard to notice what doesn't do,
            <br />
            simply there, but where?
            <br />

            cuz the internet cant provide a place for him
            <br />
            to write
            <br />
            he knows the light
            <br />

            <br />
            let him shine
            <br />
            don't put him out
            <br />
            it ain't yet your time

            2: I mean I'm doomed!
            <br />
                the two that I knew
            <br />
                went and got their own room,

                now it's me and this dude
            <br />
                who are seemingly glued
            <br />
                and I'd hate to be rude
            <br />
                but I'm the sort of guy who'd
            <br />
                rather live alone, unglued,
            <br />
                just me in solitude
            <br />

            <p>the imagination is dirt
            <br />
            it a garden, growing whatever seeds are planted
            <br />
            water it by being creative
            <br />
            plant seeds by gathering ideas
            <br />
            combine ideas to form different seeds
            <br />
            plant as many seeds as your garden can handle without sacrificing one seed's needs for another's
            <br />
            water is necessary and sufficient
            <br />
            there is a fucking drought</p>
