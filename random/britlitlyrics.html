        <h3>John Donne - Song</h3>
        <p>Sweetest love, I do not go,<br />    For weariness of thee,<br />Nor in hope the world can show<br />    A fitter love for me;<br />        But since that I<br />Must die at last, 'tis best<br />To use myself in jest<br />    Thus by feign'd deaths to die.<br /><br />Yesternight the sun went hence,<br />    And yet is here today;<br />He hath no desire nor sense,<br />    Nor half so short a way:<br />        Then fear not me,<br />But believe that I shall make<br />Speedier journeys, since I take<br />    More wings and spurs than he.<br /><br />O how feeble is man's power,<br />     That if good fortune fall,<br />Cannot add another hour,<br />    Nor a lost hour recall!<br />        But come bad chance,<br />And we join to'it our strength,<br />And we teach it art and length,<br />    Itself o'er us to'advance.<br /><br />When thou sigh'st, thou sigh'st not wind,<br />    But sigh'st my soul away;<br />When thou weep'st, unkindly kind,<br />    My life's blood doth decay.<br />        It cannot be<br />That thou lov'st me, as thou say'st,<br />If in thine my life thou waste,<br />    That art the best of me.<br /><br />Let not thy divining heart<br />    Forethink me any ill;<br />Destiny may take thy part,<br />    And may thy fears fulfil;<br />        But think that we<br />Are but turn'd aside to sleep;<br />They who one another keep<br />    Alive, ne'er parted be.</p>

        <h3>John Donne - A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning</h3>
        <p>As virtuous men pass mildly away,<br />     And whisper to their souls, to go,<br />Whilst some of their sad friends do say,<br />     'The breath goes now,' and some say, 'No:'<br /><br />So let us melt, and make no noise,<br />    No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;<br />'Twere profanation of our joys<br />    To tell the laity our love.<br /><br />Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears;<br />    Men reckon what it did, and meant;<br />But trepidation of the spheres,<br />    Though greater far, is innocent.<br /><br />Dull sublunary lovers' love<br />    (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit<br />Absence, because it doth remove<br />    Those things which elemented it.<br /><br />But we by a love so much refin'd,<br />    That ourselves know not what it is,<br />Inter-assured of the mind,<br />    Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.<br /><br />Our two souls therefore, which are one,<br />    Though I must go, endure not yet<br />A breach, but an expansion,<br />    Like gold to airy thinness beat.<br /><br />If they be two, they are two so<br />    As stiff twin compasses are two;<br />Thy soul, the fix'd foot, makes no show<br />    To move, but doth, if the' other do.<br /><br />And though it in the centre sit,<br />    Yet when the other far doth roam,<br />It leans, and hearkens after it,<br />    And grows erect, as that comes home.<br /><br />Such wilt thou be to me, who must<br />    Like th' other foot, obliquely run;<br />Thy firmness makes my circle just,<br />    And makes me end, where I begun. </p>

        <p>Death, be not proud, though some have called thee<br />Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;<br />For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow,<br />Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.<br />From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,<br />Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,<br />And soonest our best men with thee do go,<br />Rest of their bones, and soul's delivery.<br />Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,<br />And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell;<br />And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well<br />And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then?<br />One short sleep past, we wake eternally,<br />And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die. </p>

        <h3>John Donne - Meditation 17</h3>
        <p>PERCHANCE he for whom this bell tolls may be so ill, as that he knows not it tolls for him; and perchance I may think myself so much better than I am, as that they who are about me, and see my state, may have caused it to toll for me, and I know not that. The church is Catholic, universal, so are all her actions; all that she does belongs to all. When she baptizes a child, that action concerns me; for that child is thereby connected to that body which is my head too, and ingrafted into that body whereof I am a member. And when she buries a man, that action concerns me: all mankind is of one author, and is one volume; when one man dies, one chapter is not torn out of the book, but translated into a better language; and every chapter must be so translated; God employs several translators; some pieces are translated by age, some by sickness, some by war, some by justice; but God's hand is in every translation, and his hand shall bind up all our scattered leaves again for that library where every book shall lie open to one another. As therefore the bell that rings to a sermon calls not upon the preacher only, but upon the congregation to come, so this bell calls us all; but how much more me, who am brought so near the door by this sickness. There was a contention as far as a suit (in which both piety and dignity, religion and estimation, were mingled), which of the religious orders should ring to prayers first in the morning; and it was determined, that they should ring first that rose earliest. If we understand aright the dignity of this bell that tolls for our evening prayer, we would be glad to make it ours by rising early, in that application, that it might be ours as well as his, whose indeed it is. The bell doth toll for him that thinks it doth; and though it intermit again, yet from that minute that that occasion wrought upon him, he is united to God. Who casts not up his eye to the sun when it rises? but who takes off his eye from a comet when that breaks out? Who bends not his ear to any bell which upon any occasion rings? but who can remove it from that bell which is passing a piece of himself out of this world?<br><br>No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were: any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bells tolls; it tolls for thee. Neither can we call this a begging of misery, or a borrowing of misery, as though we were not miserable enough of ourselves, but must fetch in more from the next house, in taking upon us the misery of our neighbours. Truly it were an excusable covetousness if we did, for affliction is a treasure, and scarce any man hath enough of it. No man hath affliction enough that is not matured and ripened by and made fit for God by that affliction. If a man carry treasure in bullion, or in a wedge of gold, and have none coined into current money, his treasure will not defray him as he travels. Tribulation is treasure in the nature of it, but it is not current money in the use of it, except we get nearer and nearer our home, heaven, by it. Another man may be sick too, and sick to death, and this affliction may lie in his bowels, as gold in a mine, and be of no use to him; but this bell, that tells me of his affliction, digs out and applies that gold to me: if by this consideration of another's danger I take mine own into contemplation, and so secure myself, by making my recourse to my God, who is our only security.</p>
